# bassline_transcription

This repository contains an automatic bassline transcriber system that was designed for our Senior Design Project ELEC491 at Ko√ß University, Istanbul / Turkey.

It estimates the beat positions using madmom, detects a drop by our custom algorithm then takes this drop as a chorus section and extracts the bassline using demucs_extra.

The isolated bassline in the beat grid then transcribed using pYIN, confidence filtered. Finally it is adaptively quantized by our custom algorithm and converted to a midi file

where middle C is taken as C4.
