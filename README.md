# bassline_transcription

This repository contains an automatic bassline transcriber system that was designed for our Senior Design Project ELEC491 at Ko√ß University, Istanbul / Turkey.

It estimates the beat positions using madmom, detects a drop by our custom algorithm then takes this drop as a chorus section and extracts the bassline using demucs_extra.

The isolated bassline in the beat grid then transcribed using pYIN, confidence filtered. Finally it is adaptively quantized by our custom algorithm and converted to a midi file

where middle C is taken as C4.

How to Use:

1) Run create_directories.py from the project directory.

    It will create the json file that keeps the file structure and create some of the main directories.

2) Put your audio clips to data/audio_clips directory

3) Create a track_dicts.json file

    This file must hold the BPM, key informatin of the tracks.
    An example can be found in data/metadata/track_dicts.json

4.1) Bassline Extraction Only:

    from the root directory,

    python extract_basslines.py 

    If you want to specify a directory containing audio files, specify it with --audio-dir argument,

    If you want to specify a track_dicts.json file, specify it with --track-dicts argument.

    Default locations are specified in steps 2 and 3
